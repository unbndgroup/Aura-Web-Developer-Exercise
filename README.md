Please clone or fork the repo to commit and push your changes

This interview containes two coding exercises described below. Please feel free to contact us luke@unbnd.com.au if any of the questions or instructions  are unclear

## Exercise 1

Recreate the [ThisIsAura](https://thisisaura.com/) landing page for the Unbnd Aura website. Feel free to use your creativity and imagination to produce a cohesive design.

### Requirements
- We are interested in simplicity and your command of front-end development languages rather than libraries and frameworks. However, you may use any HTML/CSS/JS library or - framework.
- Please use your judgement to make this page responsive. Simpler versions of elements on mobile is ok.
- You may use a CSS framework if you like, but extra consideration will be given if you can showcase your command of simple media queries. Bonus points for exampling a "mobile first" approach.

## Exercise 2

Use JavaScript to build interactive 3D web interface.

### Requirements
- Render a primitive mesh with video texture (video format: mp4)
- Render a mesh that controls the play and pause of the video when clicked
- Implement touch controls to pan the scene camera. 

Feel free to use WebGL or three.js or any other web 3D framework. Use of three.js and WebGL appreciated

## Bonus Points

- The use of SASS compiled down to CSS
- The use of a build tool to automate the compilation of SASS and / or minification of JS or CSS. Use of webpack and node modules is encouraged

## Finish

Once the application has been written, please email at luke@unbnd.com.au

## Submission format
Preferred option is a link to public git repository with your solution. Alternatively a [git-bundle](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle) or zip archive are acceptable.

## How the submission will be evaluated 

The solution and documentation will be rated against the following categories:

- Command of Languages
- Best Practices
- Intentional and Strategic Organization of Code
- Efficiency and Cleanliness in Code
- Browser Compatibility
- Attention to Detail
- Usability

The documentation is as important as the code. We are looking to understand why you chose a certain solution and what trade offs it has. Be prepared to answer any question about your solution at the next interview stage.
